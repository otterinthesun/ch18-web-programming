//Define a function `renderTracks()` that takes as a parameter an object with a
//`results` property containing an array of music tracks; similar to the above 
//`EXAMPLE_SEARCH_RESULTS` variable.
//For each item in the `results` array, this function should add a new `<div>` 
//element into the `#records` div representing that track. The new <div> should 
//have the following child elements:
//  - an <img> element whose `src` is the artwork url of the track
//  - a <p> element containing the name of the track
//  - an <audio> element whose `src` is the the preview url. Also give the 
//    element a `controls` attribute with a value of `true`
//You can test the function by calling it and passing it `EXAMPLE_SEARCH_RESULTS`.


//Create a variable `searchUri` that is the URI to search iTunes for songs.
//You will need to concatenate a URI string with the following components:
// - The endpoint is `https://itunes.apple.com/search`
// - Include query parameters (after a `?`):
//    - an `entity` of `song` (e.g., `entity=song`)
//    - a `term` that is a search term of your choosing.
//Log out the variable for testing.


//Define a function `downloadTracks()` that sends an AJAX request to the 
//`searchUri`, and logs out the resulting data.
//Remember to make the function `async` and to `await` the download to finish.
//Call the function to test it.


//Modify your `downloadTracks()` function so that it calls your `renderTracks()`
//function in order to display the live data! (Be sure to not show the example
//tracks)
